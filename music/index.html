	<h2> Music </h2>
		<p> Hello! My name is Gavin Unguren and I love anything and everything that has to do with music. Music has been a very big part of my life ever since I was eight years old, and I hope it will continue to be a big part of my life. </p>
		<p>I have participated in many different competitions in choir, band, and soloing but I think the accomplishments that I am most proud of are in piano Federation and Concerto. Piano Federation is a competition between many piano soloist where you have to learn and memorize 2 solo piano pieces and perform them in front of judges. I was able to perform in Federation for 8 years and recieve Superior ratings.
		Piano Concertos are basically the same thing was Federation but instead you perform a memorized duet in front of judges. I think that being able to perform memorized songs in front of judges has given me the ability to work hard on one specific thing, and to work under pressure.</p>
		<p>I think that the person that inspired me to enjoy and appreciate music was my first piano teacher. My piano teacher was able to help me learn how to read music and how to put my emotions into my playing. I think that I actually developed the interest myself because nobody can force you to like something that you don't like. </p>
